The Healthy application is a small calculator of some parameters that affect human health, which can be obtained based on the data entered by the user. 
The app will help you find out the recommended amount of fluid and calories per day, as well as calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) and tell you what this number means. 
This application is created solely for educational purposes and in no way replaces the testimony of your attending physician or the results of laboratory tests
